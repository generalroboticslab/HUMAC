## Introduction
This project focuses on real-robot experiments aimed at exploring multi-agent coordination in dynamic indoor environments. The experiments involve autonomous agents collaborating to complete tasks such as target tracking, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.

---

## Features
- Real-time control of multiple autonomous robots.
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance and multi-agent collaboration.
- ROS integration for communication between robots and central controllers.
- Data logging for performance evaluation and analysis.
- Visualization tools for reviewing robot trajectories and interactions.

---

## System Requirements

### Hardware:
- 2 Differential-drive robots (e.g., TurtleBot3)
- Motion Capture System (e.g., Vicon or OptiTrack) for precise tracking
- Onboard computing (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC)
- Wireless network for communication between robots and controller

### Software:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- ROS Noetic
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- NumPy for data analysis
